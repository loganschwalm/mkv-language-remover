# mkv-language-remover

The purpose of this container is to go through you movies directory and convert all mp4 and m2ts file to mkv and then remove a specific language from those movies.

Currently it is hard coded to remove Russian and Ukrainian but in the future this will be made into a unraid template so the languages can be selected by the user

The container can be found here: https://hub.docker.com/r/bbergle/mkv-language-remover/tags
